# This YAML was auto-generated based on an architecture 
# designed in LangGraph Builder (https://build.langchain.com).
#
# The YAML was used by langgraph-gen (https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-gen-py) 
# to generate a code stub for a LangGraph application that follows the architecture.
#
# langgraph-gen is an open source CLI tool that converts YAML specifications into LangGraph code stubs.
#
# The code stub generated from this YAML can be found in stub.py.
#
# A placeholder implementation for the generated stub can be found in implementation.py.
