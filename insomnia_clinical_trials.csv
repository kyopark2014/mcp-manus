NCT03310827,DNA-based Dietary Advice for Adults With Depressive Disorders,"To evaluate the feasibility of nutrigenomics as an intervention for mental health conditions, a phase I randomized controlled trial of 42 adults (19 to 50 years) with depressive disorders using a 2:1 ratio of group selection (28 in the intervention {I} group and 14 in the control {C} group) is proposed. Participants with a confirmed depressive disorder will be recruited from two local mental health clinics. Those randomized into the I group will do the gene testing and be provided personalized DNA-based dietary advice from a registered dietitian; those in the C group will also receive testing but be given general dietary advice by a registered dietitian. Pre- and post-intervention comparisons (3 and 6 weeks after a personalized nutrition plan is given) will be analyzed based on records of dietary intakes (i.e., 3 day food records and food frequency questionnaire) and psychiatric functioning (e.g., Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Outcome Questionnaire - OQ-45). In addition, measures that track physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep quality as well as sociodemographics will be included as covariates. After the intervention study is completed, in-depth focus group interviews will be conducted. Participants will be asked questions that will elicit their perceptions of the nutrigenomics test and the personalized dietary advice provided as well as the behavioural response to disclosure of genetic information.",Depression

NCT04833673,"The Effects of Relaxation Techniques on Pain, Fatigue and Kinesiophobia in Multiple Sclerosis Patients: A Three Arms Randomized Trial","Even though, current treatments including IVIG, corticosteroids, biological agents can provide positive effects on MS symptoms, MS cannot be cured completely today. Therefore, in addition to the available medical treatment options, patients may tend towards complementary and integrative therapies. Relaxation techniques are one of the non-pharmacological and side-effect-free therapy options that are currently used to alleviate the symptoms of many different chronic diseases. Progressive muscle relaxation exercise (PMR) and Benson relaxation technique (BRT) are two common types of relaxation techniques recommended for symptom management in chronic diseases owing to simple to learn and apply compared to other complementary and integrative methods for patients. PMR is uncomplicated and low-cost method, originally designed by Jacobson (1938), which helps individuals to feel calmer through consecutive muscle tension and relaxation of a muscle group. This method can relieve muscle tension, facilitate sleep, and reduce severity of pain and fatigue. There are studies in the literature reporting the positive effects of PMR on fatigue, sleep quality, quality of life, anxiety and stress in MS patients. One of these techniques which is well tolerated is BRT, designed by Herbert Benson in the 1970s as a nonpharmacologic and behavioral method. This technique led to relaxation using mental imagery and mediation. BRT creates a relaxation influence in the body by decreasing the sympathetic nervous system activity and increasing the parasympathetic nervous system activity. There are few studies in the literature reporting that BRT is beneficial on pain and fatigue in MS patients.To the best of our knowledge, there is no study on the impact of relaxation techniques on pain, fatigue and kinesophobia in MS patients. The aim of this study was to examine and compare the effects of PMR and BRT on abovementioned symptoms in MS patients.","Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting|Pain, Chronic|Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic|Kinesiophobia"

NCT02169531,Ex Vivo Immunotherapy for Hyperglycemia in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a long-term metabolic disorder that is primarily characterized by insulin resistance, relative insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Our hypotheses is that liver would be the primary organ responsible for the metabolic disorder because of some unknown defects, where sugar would not be efficiently converted to glycogen and fat, leading to hyperglycemia. The constant hyperglycemia would keep pressure on beta-cells in the pancreas to eventually exhaust their ability to produce and secret sufficient amount of insulin, exacerbating the disease. The Immunotherapy would enhance the liver functions and correct the abnormal sugar metabolism. In addition, the ex vivo activated cells produce and secret growth factors which would help endothelial cells of blood vessels to reproduce and grow, resulting in reduced arteriosclerosis.",Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus|Hyperglycemia
NCT05800431,NESA Microcurrents on Quality of Life in Geriatric Patients,"In recent years, the population of older adults (MA) in the world has been increasing, due to the increase in life expectancy and the decrease in the fertility rate. The United Nations (UN) places Spain as the most aged country in the world in the year 2050, with 40% of its population over 60 years of age. There is evidence that quality of life in the elderly is associated with variables linked to physical and psychological health. Thus, for example, previous research indicates that perceived health and cognitive functioning influence the perception of quality of life.The NESA XSIGNAL® device is a low-frequency, non-invasive neuromodulation device that uses microcurrents to restore electrical balance in the body. This technology is approved as medical equipment and is CE marked.This non-invasive neuromodulation equipment is starting to have promising results in patients with sleep disorders.

NCT06837831,Efficacy of Mepilex Lite Dressings in Treating Anal Pain,"BACKGROUND: Rectal cancer is a common gastrointestinal tumor, and low and intermediate rectal cancer accounts for 90% of rectal cancer. Radiotherapy is one of the important means of rectal cancer treatment, but the radiotoxicity induced by radiotherapy should not be neglected. As normal tissues around the target organ of radiotherapy, the anal canal is damaged by radiation and mucous membrane damage occurs, which is manifested as mucous membrane congestion, edema and ulceration, etc., and pain in the anal area occurs. With the accumulation of radiotherapy dose, the mucosal damage of the anal canal becomes more and more serious, and the anal pain of the patients is severe, which seriously affects the life quality of the patients. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of mepilex lite dressings combined with indomethacin suppositories in the treatment of anal pain in patients undergoing radiotherapy for low and intermediate rectal cancer.METHODS: The study protocol will be a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A randomized grouping method was used to divide the participants into an observation group (n=98) and a control group (n=98). The control group was given routine nursing measures, and the experimental group was given mepilex lite dressings for intra-anal insertion combined with indomethacin suppository for anal administration on the basis of routine nursing measures. The primary outcome indicator was anal pain score. Secondary outcome indicators were anxiety score, sleep quality score and comfort score. Assessments were made at baseline (anal pain NRS score ≥7 in patients undergoing radiotherapy for low to intermediate rectal cancer), day 1, day 7 and day 14 post-intervention. Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS 25.0 and a significance level of p≤0.05 will be used for all tests.","Rectal Cancer, Radiotherapy|Anal Pain"

NCT04993482,24-hour Movement Behaviors Among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients,"A healthy lifestyle has proved beneficial health effects in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Important lifestyle behaviors, i.e. sleep, sedentary time (SB), and physical activity (PA) subdivided into light physical activity (LPA) and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), have shown an impact on T2DM disease-specific characteristics (e.g. glycemic control). However, these behaviors have often been investigated separately. Therefore, a recent shift in research emphasizes the importance of considering these behaviors as part of a 24-hour day.Since T2DM patients can benefit from an optimal 24-hour composition as part of a healthy lifestyle, it may be interesting to investigate the 24-hour movement composition among these T2DM patients over time. Moreover, exploring associations with different personal determinants, environmental determinants, and cardiometabolic markers will provide meaningful insights in developing recommendations and creating an intervention.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"

NCT04972773,Spinal Cord Injury Mental Health Functional Outcomes Improved by Mindfulness,"Recovery from injury is an immune function but also involves stress. Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients are one population with a difficult recovery journey. Improvements in SCI rehabilitation could benefit patient's recovery and decrease their functional limitations. Lack of independence and chronic pain contributes to a higher rate of mental health problems (48.5%) and clinical stress (25%) in SCI patients. Depression is more common among auto-immune phenotypes and depression patients have higher pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles, suggesting stress impacts the immune system and thus opposes recovery. Mindfulness meditation (MM) is one form of stress-reduction therapy, which also decreases anxiety, depression, and pain. Little research has investigated whether this extends to functional outcomes of mental health during recovery. The investigators will look at the ""functional outcomes of mental health"", including stress, pain, quality of life, quality of sleep, and outcomes of depression using validated surveys. The investigators hypothesize that MM will significantly improve functional outcomes of mental health in SCI patients during their rehabilitation in a dose-dependent fashion, compared to 'standard therapy' alone control, with effects sustained 1-month post-intervention. Patients will take surveys of their mindfulness practices and mental health functional outcomes at 0 weeks (baseline), 8 weeks (post-treatment), and 12 weeks (follow-up). MM will be delivered to a randomized sample of SCI patients via one of three MM apps for 8 weeks. Linear regression will identify if patients practicing more MM have better mental health functional outcomes in a dose-dependent manner. The findings from this study will provide evidence of sustained stress-relief and mental health functional outcomes of consumer-based MM apps, which can be applied to improve SCI rehabilitation in an accessible manner.",Spinal Cord Injuries|Mindfulness Meditation|Mental Health Wellness 1

NCT06623682,Study of Self-Help and Support Services for Student Mental Health in Tertiary Institutions,"This proposed study aims to evaluate the implementation of integrating the existing services in tertiary education institutions with the JCTH+ platform. The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of JCTH+ on students' mental health outcomes as compared to service as usual, and to assess the cost-utility of the platform to determine whether the benefits of implementing the platform justify the costs associated. It is hypothesized that participants who receive integrated self-help and support services will show (H1) a greater reduction in mental health symptoms, and (H2) better mental well-being compared with participants in the control condition, i.e. service-as-usual (SAU).",Mental Health|Mental Well-being|Psychological Intervention|Self-care
NCT00837382,Imagery Rescripting for Posttraumatic Nightmares in Rural Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),"Many service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have difficulties adjusting back to civilian life. Research shows that symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are particularly high in returning Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) veterans, and that combat-related nightmares and sleep disturbances are common in veterans with PTSD. This is of concern because people with these problems will often use unhealthy ways of coping. Although combat-related nightmares and difficulty sleeping are highly distressing, there are helpful treatments that do not involve taking medication. One of these treatments teaches specific skills to help people improve their sleep habits and to change their nightmares so that they are less upsetting. This treatment can be very helpful and research shows that people experience decreases in the frequency and severity of their nightmares, decreased symptoms of depression and PTSD, and improved sleep quality and quantity after completing treatment. However, because this treatment has only been studied with civilians, it is not clear how well this treatment works for returning veterans. This study tests how well this treatment works in treating combat nightmares in veterans who also have PTSD from experiencing a traumatic event.","Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic|Sleep Disorders"
NCT01613131,Mirena and Estrogen for Control of Perimenopause Symptoms and Ovulation Suppression,"Hormonal treatment of perimenopausal women has frequently utilized oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Because of their ability to suppress ovulation and establish cycle control, OCPs have become a popular option, and one that is FDA approved for use until menopause. However, use of OCPs in women in their 40's and 50's carries significant cardiovascular risks. Venous thromboembolism risk is 3-6 fold greater in OCP users, and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) is approximately doubled in OCP users over the age of 40. This occurs at an age where the background population risk of MI begins to increase, such that the absolute number of cases rises substantially. Women with additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease have a much greater risk for MI (6-40-fold) in association with OCPs. There are also large subgroups of midlife women who are not candidates for OCP use, such a smokers and migraineurs. Moreover, the trend towards lower estrogen dosing with OCPs containing 20 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol has not led to a detectable decrease in thromboembolic risk.Because of their increased potential risks, it is appropriate to seek alternatives to OCPs and to explore lower doses of hormones to relieve perimenopausal symptoms that occur prior to a woman's final menses. Recent evidence indicates that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis of reproductively aging women is more susceptible to suppression by sex steroids that previously believed. It is possible that hormone doses as low as 50 micrograms of transdermal estradiol (TDE) can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary axis of midlife women. It is also tempting to speculate that the low but measurable circulating doses of levonorgestrel that are present when a woman uses the Mirena intrauterine system (IUS) can contribute to or even independently suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and reduce the hormonal fluctuations that result in worsening of perimenopausal symptoms. The combination of low dose TDE plus Mirena may therefore confer superior symptom control as well as contraceptive effectiveness, at far less risk.",Menopausal and Other Perimenopausal Disorders
NCT05782231,Improving Health for Older Adults With Pain Through Engagement (Open-pilot),"The goal of this project is to conduct an open-pilot (N=30) to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of a mind-body and activity program (GetActive+) with older adults with chronic pain. The investigators will test for improvements in self-reported, performance-based (i.e., six-minute walk test), and objective (i.e., step-count) physical function, emotional function, as well as feasibility, acceptability and implementation markers. Participants will complete measures at baseline and post-intervention.This study received support from and inclusion in the HEAL Initiative (https://heal.nih.gov/).",Chronic Pain|Musculoskeletal Pain
NCT01793831,Standardized Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Crohn's Diseases,"The gut microbiota is considered to constitute a ""microbial organ"" which has pivotal roles in the intestinal diseases and body's metabolism. Evidence from animal and human studies strongly supports the link between intestinal bacteria and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Dozens of studies reported its efficacy in treatment of severe Clostridium difficile colitis. Preliminary studies using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for Ulcerative Colitis (UC), Crohn's diseases (CD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and constipation have also met with some success. However, the results on CD is very limited. This marks the initial step in exploring the potential efficacy of fecal bacteriotherapy for CD. The investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness, durability, and safety of FMT in a cohort of at least 500 patients with CD over a ten-year period",Inflammatory Bowel Disease|Crohn&#39;s Disease (CD)
