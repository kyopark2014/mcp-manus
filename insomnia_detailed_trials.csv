NCT03310827,DNA-based Dietary Advice for Adults With Depressive Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03310827,,UNKNOWN,"To evaluate the feasibility of nutrigenomics as an intervention for mental health conditions, a phase I randomized controlled trial of 42 adults (19 to 50 years) with depressive disorders using a 2:1 ratio of group selection (28 in the intervention {I} group and 14 in the control {C} group) is proposed. Participants with a confirmed depressive disorder will be recruited from two local mental health clinics. Those randomized into the I group will do the gene testing and be provided personalized DNA-based dietary advice from a registered dietitian; those in the C group will also receive testing but be given general dietary advice by a registered dietitian. Pre- and post-intervention comparisons (3 and 6 weeks after a personalized nutrition plan is given) will be analyzed based on records of dietary intakes (i.e., 3 day food records and food frequency questionnaire) and psychiatric functioning (e.g., Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Outcome Questionnaire - OQ-45). In addition, measures that track physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep quality as well as sociodemographics will be included as covariates. After the intervention study is completed, in-depth focus group interviews will be conducted.

NCT04833673,"The Effects of Relaxation Techniques on Pain, Fatigue and Kinesiophobia in Multiple Sclerosis Patients: A Three Arms Randomized Trial",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04833673,,COMPLETED,"Even though, current treatments including IVIG, corticosteroids, biological agents can provide positive effects on MS symptoms, MS cannot be cured completely today. Therefore, in addition to the available medical treatment options, patients may tend towards complementary and integrative therapies. Relaxation techniques are one of the non-pharmacological and side-effect-free therapy options that are currently used to alleviate the symptoms of many different chronic diseases. Progressive muscle relaxation exercise (PMR) and Benson relaxation technique (BRT) are two common types of relaxation techniques recommended for symptom management in chronic diseases owing to simple to learn and apply compared to other complementary and integrative methods for patients. PMR is uncomplicated and low-cost method, originally designed by Jacobson (1938), which helps individuals to feel calmer through consecutive muscle tension and relaxation of a muscle group. This method can relieve muscle tension, facilitate sleep, and reduce severity of pain and fatigue. There are studies in the literature reporting the positive effects of PMR on fatigue, sleep quality, quality of life, anxiety and stress in MS patients. One of these techniques which is well tolerated is BRT, designed by Herbert Benson in the 1970s as a nonpharmacologic and behavioral method. This technique led to relaxation using mental imagery and mediation. BRT creates a relaxation influence in the body by decreasing the sympathetic nervous system activity and increasing the parasympathetic nervous system activity. There are few studies in the literature reporting that BRT is beneficial on pain and fatigue in MS patients.To the best of our knowledge, there is no study on the impact of relaxation techniques on pain, fatigue and kinesophobia in MS patients.

NCT06837831,Efficacy of Mepilex Lite Dressings in Treating Anal Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06837831,,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"BACKGROUND: Rectal cancer is a common gastrointestinal tumor, and low and intermediate rectal cancer accounts for 90% of rectal cancer. Radiotherapy is one of the important means of rectal cancer treatment, but the radiotoxicity induced by radiotherapy should not be neglected. As normal tissues around the target organ of radiotherapy, the anal canal is damaged by radiation and mucous membrane damage occurs, which is manifested as mucous membrane congestion, edema and ulceration, etc., and pain in the anal area occurs. With the accumulation of radiotherapy dose, the mucosal damage of the anal canal becomes more and more serious, and the anal pain of the patients is severe, which seriously affects the life quality of the patients. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of mepilex lite dressings combined with indomethacin suppositories in the treatment of anal pain in patients undergoing radiotherapy for low and intermediate rectal cancer.METHODS: The study protocol will be a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A randomized grouping method was used to divide the participants into an observation group (n=98) and a control group (n=98). The control group was given routine nursing measures, and the experimental group was given mepilex lite dressings for intra-anal insertion combined with indomethacin suppository for anal administration on the basis of routine nursing measures. The primary outcome indicator was anal pain score. Secondary outcome indicators were anxiety score, sleep quality score and comfort score. Assessments were made at baseline (anal pain NRS score ≥7 in patients undergoing radiotherapy for low to intermediate rectal cancer), day 1, day 7 and day 14 post-intervention. Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS 25.0 and a significance level of p≤0.05 will be used for all tests.",NO,"Rectal Cancer, Radiotherapy|Anal Pain",OTHER: Control group|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Experimental group,"Assessment of anal pain, A digital scoring method (NRS score) was used to evaluate the degree of anal pain of patients. 0-L0 scores were used to replace different degrees of pain. 0 scores meant no pain, 1-3 was classified as mild pain, 4-6 was classified as moderate pain, and 7-l0 was classified as severe pain, Patients with rectal pain and NRS score ≥7 were evaluated at baseline，Assessment was performed again on day 1, day 7, and day 14 after intervention",,,Qianfoshan Hospital,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,196,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,Zlflk2025,2024-12-06,2026-12-06,2026-12-06,2025-02-20,,2025-02-25,"The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, 250000, China",
