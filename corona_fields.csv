NCT04417127,Harambee: Integrated Community-based HIV/NCD Care & Microfinance Groups in Kenya,"The objective of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness and longer-term sustainability of a differentiated care delivery model for improving HIV treatment outcomes. The central hypothesis is that the integration of community-based HIV and NCD care with group microfinance will improve retention in care and rates of viral suppression (VS) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Kenya via two mechanisms: improved household economic status and easier access to care.The specific aims are as follows:1. To evaluate the extent to which integrated community-based HIV care with group microfinance affects retention in care and VS among n=900 PLHIV in rural western Kenya using a cluster randomized intervention design of n=40 existing (fully HIV+) microfinance groups to receive either: (A) integrated community-based HIV and NCD care or (B) standard care. Data from the two trial arms will be augmented with a matched contemporaneous control group of n=300 patients receiving standard care and not involved in microfinance (group C), comparing outcomes in groups A, B and C. The hypothesize is that A \> B \> C in terms of viral suppression and retention in care.2. To identify specific mechanisms through which microfinance and integrated community-based care impact VS. Using a mixed methods approach, the study will characterize the mechanisms of effect on patient outcomes. Investigators will conduct quantitative mediation analysis to examine two main mediating pathways (household economic conditions and easier access to care), as well as exploratory mechanisms (food security, social support, HIV- related stigma). Investigators will also use qualitative methods and multi-stakeholder panels to contextualize implementation of the intervention.3. To assess the cost-effectiveness of microfinance and integrated community-based care delivery to maximize future policy and practice relevance of this promising intervention strategy. The working hypothesis is that the differentiated model will be cost-effective in terms of cost per HIV suppressed person-time, cost per patient retained in care, and cost per disability-adjusted life year saved.The main expected outcomes will be rigorous evidence of effectiveness, mechanisms and cost-effectiveness of a differentiated model for achieving the last key step in the HIV care continuum. These results are expected to have an important positive impact in terms of improved, high-quality services that address known individual and structural barriers to care and promote long-term sustainability of care for PLHIV in rural settings with high HIV prevalence.",HIV/AIDS|Noncommunicable Diseases|Hypertension|Diabetes
NCT00947427,Canakinumab Study in Individuals With Newly Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes,"Canakinumab is a fully human anti-interleukin-1β (anti-IL-1β) monoclonal antibody (IgG-1 class). Canakinumab is designed to bind to human IL-1β and to functionally neutralize the bioactivity of this pro-inflammatory cytokine.The study is a two-arm, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial. 66 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either monthly subcutaneous injections of 2.0 mg/kg Canakinumab, or placebo for 12 months. All groups will receive standard intensive diabetes treatment with insulin and dietary management.Participants randomly assigned to Canakinumab treatment or placebo will receive a total of 12 injections over one year.All subjects will be followed for 1 year of treatment plus 1- 3 years of additional follow-up until study end.

NCT02614027,Prevalence of Lipodystrophy Syndrome and Its Role as Cause of Metabolic Disturbances,"To evaluate the prevalence of lipodystrophy syndrome in patients receiving currently available antiretroviral drugs, and the prevalence of associated metabolic syndrome in HIV-infected patients with a previous diagnosis of lipodystrophy syndrome, according to the severity of fat accumulation and antiretroviral drug use.",Lipodystrophy|Metabolic Syndrome
NCT01462227,Effect of Naltrexone on Counterregulatory Mechanisms in Hypoglycemia,"Insulin treatment often causes the blood glucose levels to fall too low. The body usually responds to low blood glucose levels by releasing hormones which act against the insulin to help correct the low blood glucose levels. However, this hormone response can be altered in people with diabetes. Currently there are no therapeutic agents that can be used to improve the recovery from hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Naltrexone is a tablet used to help people who are addicted to alcohol or morphine-based drugs to remain drug and alcohol-free but it can also affect the levels of the hormones which are released during hypoglycemia. The aim of this study is to determine whether naltrexone can be used to improve and accelerate the recovery from hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes.",Hypoglycemia
NCT05149573,Investigation of PEMF Therapy for Female Patients With IC/BPS,"The purpose of this study is to gather information about the safety and effectiveness of the non-pharmacological (non-drug), non-invasive treatment known as low-frequency pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy. The study team will distribute the PEMF device to female adults with Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) to measure its ability to decrease bladder and pelvic pain as well as other urinary symptoms associated with IC/BPS. There are two sequential Aims in this study and subjects will be recruited to participate in only one Aim. In both Aims, data will be collected at baseline/enrollment, 4-weeks after using PEMF therapy, and 8, 12, and 16 weeks post-enrollment.",Interstitial Cystitis|Chronic Interstitial Cystitis|Bladder Pain Syndrome
NCT01170273,Vitamin D in Vulnerable Adults (VIVA-VA),"Vitamin D insufficiency is a problem of growing concern, given its prevalence in older persons and the association of low vitamin D with multiple major health problems, including mobility and balance deterioration and falls, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Sedentary persons are particularly vulnerable for these health problems and generally not adherent to prescribed physical activity. This study will investigate if treatment with vitamin D will benefit physical performance in male veterans age 65 to 95.",Frail Elderly|Vitamin d Deficiency
NCT00609973,Ciprofloxacin for the Prevention of Postoperative Endoscopic Recurrence in Crohn's Disease,"Despite extensive medical treatment, surgical resection is required in approximately 70% of the patients at some time. However, recurrence of the disease after operation occurs in the majority of patients and is a serious limitation of surgical management. Therapeutic options to maintain postoperative clinical remission are urgently needed. Several drugs including mesalazine, antibiotics (metronidazole, ornidazole) and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine have been studied in the past. But the efficacy is very limited (mesalazine), overshadowed by intolerability during long-term therapy (metronidazole, ornidazole) or inconclusive (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine). Research demonstrating the absence of inflammation in patients with diverting ileostomy and the clinical benefit of a postoperative antibiotic therapy using metronidazole or ornidazole implicates a role of the resident bacterial flora in the postoperative relapse. Ciprofloxacin has a broad antibacterial spectrum. More interestingly it also suppresses E. coli strains, which can be found in high numbers in early and chronic ileal lesions of Crohn's disease patients Ciprofloxacin has demonstrated beneficial effects in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases, but the available data of the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin allow only a very limited judgement of the safety and tolerability of a 6 months therapy of ciprofloxacin. Therefore an exploratory multicenter prospective, placebo-controlled trial is planned to analyze the safety and tolerability of a 6 months therapy with ciprofloxacin compared to placebo in 40 patients (randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio) undergoing ileocecal resection (or resection of parts of the colon). If this therapeutic regimen demonstrates tolerability, a second larger study improving the superiority of ciprofloxacin versus placebo can be initiated.",Crohn's Disease
NCT03679273,Nutritional Supplement on Wound Healing in Diabetic Foot,"Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is the leading cause of non-traumatic limb loss in adult worldwide. One of the major causes of limb loss in patients with DFU is poor wound healing. It is known that nutrition plays a key role in wound healing, not only because of the required calories, but more importantly for collagen remodeling by specific amino acids (arginine, glutamine, and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate).Nevertheless, few studies have investigated nutritional supplements in patients with poor wound healing of DFU. Difficulties in assessing the severity of a wound and poor adherence to drug and food supplements at home may be important factors for the negative results shown in a most recent prospective randomized controlled trial. The diabetic foot center in Chang Gung Memorial hospital has extensive experience in caring for patients with limb-threatening DFU and we recently reported that poor nutritional status in our patients correlated to poor treatment outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and possible molecular mechanisms in nutritional treatment for limb-threatening DFU. A total of 70 patients will be enrolled and randomized into study and control groups. All subjects will receive standard care. Additional amino acid supplements containing arginine, glutamine, and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate or a control (high protein formula powder) will be given orally twice a day for 21 days, and the percentage change in wound size will then be measured. Complete healing time, recurrence or major adverse cardiac events will be recorded during one year of follow up. Data on wound size, nutritional status, and levels of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, nutrient molecules (measured by ABSOLUTE/DQ P180 KIT (LC MS/MS) will be recorded before and after the nutritional supplementation. In addition, the pioneer factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) that binds native chromatin and bookmarks genomic regions for transcriptional activity may play a role in nutritional supplements in acute stressed diabetic patients. Therefore, we intend to conduct a pilot study on the for FOXA2 gene in maintaining glucose homeostasis in diabetic foot patients after nutritional interventions.",Diabetic Foot
NCT05214573,Second-line Therapies for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Moderate Cardiovascular Disease Risk,"We will use the target trial framework for causal inference to conduct this observational retrospective cohort study that uses claims data of adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) included in the de-identified datasets of OptumLabs Data Warehouse (OLDW) and Medicare fee-for-service.In Aim 1, we will emulate a target trial comparing the effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), and sulfonylureas (SU) in adults with T2D at moderate risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with regard to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), expanded MACE, microvascular complications, severe hypoglycemia, and other adverse events.In Aim 2, we will compare these four drug classes in the same population of adults with T2D included in OLDW and Medicare fee-for-service data with respect to a set of composite outcomes identified by a group of patients with T2D as being most important to them. Specifically, in Aim 2A, we will prospectively elicit patient preferences toward various treatment outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, kidney disease) using a participatory ranking exercise, then use these rankings to generate individually weighted composite outcomes. Then, in Aim 2B, we will estimate patient-centered treatment effects of four different second-line T2D medications that reflect the patient's value for each outcome.In Aim 3, we will compare different medications within each of the four therapeutic classes with respect to MACE.",Type 2 Diabetes|Cardiac Disease
NCT05702931,Semaglutide Treatment for Hyperglycaemia After Renal Transplantation,"Background: Post-transplant hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in renal transplant recipients within the first two weeks after transplantation. Standard-of-care is primarily based on insulin treatment with the adherent risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Semaglutide produces an effective lowering of plasma glucose in diabetes patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and leads to a reduction in weight and the incidence of hypoglycaemia. The efficacy of semaglutide is untested in renal transplant recipients, and safety concerns remain, primarily on renal graft function.Objectives: The primary objective is to establish whether tablet semaglutide (Rybelsus) compared with placebo, both as add-on to standard-of-care, is non-inferior in regulating plasma glucose in patients with hyperglycaemia after renal transplantation. Secondary objectives aim to evaluate the effect of tablet semaglutide on renal graft function, weight, use of insulin, cardiovascular parameters and safety parameters (plasma semaglutide concentration, gastrointestinal side effects, dose of immunosuppressants).Design: An investigator-initiated, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, randomised trial.Population: Patients (n = 104) with post-transplant hyperglycaemia and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \> 15 ml/min/1.73 m2.Methods: Participants diagnosed with post-transplant hyperglycaemia, 10 to 15 days post-transplant, will be randomised 1:1 to either 14 weeks of tablet semaglutide once daily or placebo both as add-on to standard glucose-lowering therapy. Participants will maintain weekly contact with the clinic during the first five weeks and at two to four weeks intervals during the remaining study period. During the trial, each patient will be monitored according to blood laboratory values with safety assessed at every visit by a nephrologist. Pre-prandial plasma glucose will be measured in the morning and evening to adjust glucose-lowering therapy after consultation with an endocrinologist. Double blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will be performed for 10-14 days from baseline and at weeks 5, 9, and 13.Primary endpoint:- Mean sensor glucose (mmol/L) evaluated by CGMKey secondary endpoints:* Incidence of hypoglycaemia* Body weight (kg)* Creatinine (μmol/L)* Daily insulin dose (IE per day)* Plasma concentration of semaglutide (nmol/L)* Blood concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus (μg/L)",Hyperglycemia|Renal Transplant Complication Primary Non-Function|Diabetes
