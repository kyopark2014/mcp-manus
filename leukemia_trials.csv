NCT00002673,Immunotherapy in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Bone Marrow or Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation,RATIONALE: White blood cells from donors who have been exposed to cytomegalovirus may be able to help prevent this infection from occurring in patients who are undergoing bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation.PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of donated white blood cells to prevent cytomegalovirus infection in patients who are undergoing bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation.,Cancer
NCT02203773,Study of ABT-199 (GDC-0199) in Combination With Azacitidine or Decitabine (Chemo Combo) in Subjects With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML),"This is a Phase 1b, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of orally administered venetoclax (ABT-199) combined with decitabine or azacitidine and the preliminary efficacy of these combinations. In addition, there is a drug-drug interaction (DDI) sub-study only at a single site, to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of venetoclax (ABT-199) in combination with posaconazole.",Acute Myelogenous Leukemia|Myelogenous Leukemia|Treatment Naive AML
NCT00574873,Compare Bosutinib To Imatinib In Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase Philadelphia Chromosome Positive CML,"Two-arm, randomized, open-label trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bosutinib alone compared to imatinib alone in subjects newly diagnosed with chronic phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML). The primary endpoint is cytogenetic response rate at one year.",Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
NCT01328873,FOB in HSCT and Leukemia Patients With Acute Respiratory Symptoms and Pulmonary Infiltrates,"Pulmonary infiltrates frequently complicate the care of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and leukemia patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is frequently used to evaluate new pulmonary infiltrates in this population, however utility is limited by a historically low diagnostic yield for infection.In an effort to improve diagnostic yields, this study will complete a Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy (FOB) within 8 hours of radiographic documentation of pulmonary infiltrates, prior to initiating new antibiotic therapy. To further improve detection of microbiological pathogens, the study will utilize PCR testing with rapid turnaround time to detect atypical pneumonia (M pneumoniae, C. Pneumonia, Legionella species, and respiratory viruses) and aspergillosis.",Pulmonary Infiltrate New
NCT00925873,GOELAMS SA4 Study: the Role of Fludarabine in the Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia in the Elderly,"In this study, patients were randomly assigned to either receive fludarabine or not (20 mg/m2/d) in addition to induction chemotherapy, consolidation chemotherapy and the 3 subsequent re-induction courses during maintenance.",Acute Myeloid Leukemia
NCT00439231,Lenalidomide in Previously Treated Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma,"This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new drug called lenalidomide (Revlimid) for treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who relapsed after their initial treatment.Patients 21 years of age and older with CLL or SLL who have previously received standard treatment may be eligible for this study.Participants take lenalidomide capsules once a day for 21 days, followed by 21 days off the drug. This constitutes one treatment cycle. Treatment continues for four cycles as long as the medicine is tolerated. After four cycles, patients who respond completely continue treatment for another two cycles; patients who respond partially continue treatment for another four cycles; and patients who do not respond stop treatment but continue to be followed for safety....",Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
NCT00020527,Caspofungin Acetate in Treating Children With Fever and Neutropenia,RATIONALE: Giving caspofungin acetate may be effective in preventing or controlling fever and neutropenia caused by chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation.PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of caspofungin acetate in treating children who have fever and neutropenia caused by a weakened immune system.,"Fever, Sweats, and Hot Flashes|Infection|Kidney Cancer|Leukemia|Lymphoma|Neuroblastoma|Neutropenia|Sarcoma"
NCT01432873,Oral Selenium Therapy for the Prevention of Mucositis,"Selenium as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent could be effective in prevention of mucositis induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Other agents such as vitamin E, Zinc sulfate, amifostine, beta carotene and benzidamine are indicated for prevention of mucositis and positive effects are seen. Our purpose in this double blinded randomized study is to evaluate the selenium effect on mucositis prevention in patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) \& acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) whose received Busulfan and/or Cyclophosphamide before Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).",Mucositis|Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
NCT00001873,The Role of Cyclosporine in Blood Cell Transplants With T-Cell Add-Back for Blood Cancers,"Cancers of the blood, sometimes referred to as hematologic malignancies, are disorders of bone marrow cells that lead to the failure of the normal function of bone marrow and the uncontrolled growth of cancerous cells in the bone marrow. These cancerous cells can spill over into the bloodstream and affect other organs causing widespread symptoms. The disease is life threatening because it blocks the normal function of the marrow, which is to produce red cells (preventing anemia), white cells (preventing infection), and platelets (preventing progression).Bone marrow transplants are a potential form of therapy for patients with hematologic malignancies. However, BMT is a complicated procedure and can be associated with dangerous side effects.In this study researchers are attempting to find ways to reduce the complications of BMT, so that it would be possible to use it more safely and can be offered more patients. In order to do this, researchers are developing new techniques to make BMT safer. It requires making small changes to the standard procedure, which may improve the outcome.The experimental procedures researchers are evaluating are:1. \<TAB\>T-cell depleted peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation2. \<TAB\> Cyclosporine given immediately after the transplant3. \<TAB\>Add-back of donor lymphocytesPatients undergoing these experimental techniques must be monitored closely to see if any benefit or harmful effects will occur. Information gathered from this study can be used to develop further research studies and potential new therapies for hematologic malignancies.",Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Graft vs Host Disease|Hematologic Neoplasm|Multiple Myeloma|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
NCT03085173,"A Trial of ""Armored"" CAR T Cells Targeting CD19 For Patients With Relapsed CD19+ Hematologic Malignancies","The purpose of this phase I study is to test the safety of different dose levels of specially prepared cells collected from the patient called ""modified T cells"". The investigators want to find a safe dose of modified T cells for patients with this type of cancer that has progressed after standard therapy. The investigators also want to find out what effects these modified T cells have on the patient and the cancer.For patients who were treated, had progression of disease and were removed from study, duplicate enrollment is permitted if it is determined the patients could receive a benefit. If the patients meet all eligibility criteria, they can be enrolled onto study a second time as a new accrual, and receive treatment in a higher dose level cohort.",Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)|Relapsed|Refractory
