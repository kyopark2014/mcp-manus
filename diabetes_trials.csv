NCT04417127,Harambee: Integrated Community-based HIV/NCD Care & Microfinance Groups in Kenya,"The objective of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness and longer-term sustainability of a differentiated care delivery model for improving HIV treatment outcomes. The central hypothesis is that the integration of community-based HIV and NCD care with group microfinance will improve retention in care and rates of viral suppression (VS) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Kenya via two mechanisms: improved household economic status and easier access to care.The specific aims are as follows:1. To evaluate the extent to which integrated community-based HIV care with group microfinance affects retention in care and VS among n=900 PLHIV in rural western Kenya using a cluster randomized intervention design of n=40 existing (fully HIV+) microfinance groups to receive either: (A) integrated community-based HIV and NCD care or (B) standard care. Data from the two trial arms will be augmented with a matched contemporaneous control group of n=300 patients receiving standard care and not involved in microfinance (group C), comparing outcomes in groups A, B and C. The hypothesize is that A \> B \> C in terms of viral suppression and retention in care.2. To identify specific mechanisms through which microfinance and integrated community-based care impact VS. Using a mixed methods approach, the study will characterize the mechanisms of effect on patient outcomes. Investigators will conduct quantitative mediation analysis to examine two main mediating pathways (household economic conditions and easier access to care), as well as exploratory mechanisms (food security, social support, HIV- related stigma). Investigators will also use qualitative methods and multi-stakeholder panels to contextualize implementation of the intervention.3. To assess the cost-effectiveness of microfinance and integrated community-based care delivery to maximize future policy and practice relevance of this promising intervention strategy. The working hypothesis is that the differentiated model will be cost-effective in terms of cost per HIV suppressed person-time, cost per patient retained in care, and cost per disability-adjusted life year saved.The main expected outcomes will be rigorous evidence of effectiveness, mechanisms and cost-effectiveness of a differentiated model for achieving the last key step in the HIV care continuum. These results are expected to have an important positive impact in terms of improved, high-quality services that address known individual and structural barriers to care and promote long-term sustainability of care for PLHIV in rural settings with high HIV prevalence.",HIV/AIDS|Noncommunicable Diseases|Hypertension|Diabetes
NCT00947427,Canakinumab Study in Individuals With Newly Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes,"Canakinumab is a fully human anti-interleukin-1β (anti-IL-1β) monoclonal antibody (IgG-1 class). Canakinumab is designed to bind to human IL-1β and to functionally neutralize the bioactivity of this pro-inflammatory cytokine.The study is a two-arm, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial. 66 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either monthly subcutaneous injections of 2.0 mg/kg Canakinumab, or placebo for 12 months.

NCT02614027,Prevalence of Lipodystrophy Syndrome and Its Role as Cause of Metabolic Disturbances,"To evaluate the prevalence of lipodystrophy syndrome in patients receiving currently available antiretroviral drugs, and the prevalence of associated metabolic syndrome in HIV-infected patients with a previous diagnosis of lipodystrophy syndrome, according to the severity of fat accumulation and antiretroviral drug use.",Lipodystrophy|Metabolic Syndrome
NCT01462227,Effect of Naltrexone on Counterregulatory Mechanisms in Hypoglycemia,"Insulin treatment often causes the blood glucose levels to fall too low. The body usually responds to low blood glucose levels by releasing hormones which act against the insulin to help correct the low blood glucose levels. However, this hormone response can be altered in people with diabetes. Currently there are no therapeutic agents that can be used to improve the recovery from hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Naltrexone is a tablet used to help people who are addicted to alcohol or morphine-based drugs to remain drug and alcohol-free but it can also affect the levels of the hormones which are released during hypoglycemia. The aim of this study is to determine whether naltrexone can be used to improve and accelerate the recovery from hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes.",Hypoglycemia

NCT01170273,Vitamin D in Vulnerable Adults (VIVA-VA),"Vitamin D insufficiency is a problem of growing concern, given its prevalence in older persons and the association of low vitamin D with multiple major health problems, including mobility and balance deterioration and falls, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Sedentary persons are particularly vulnerable for these health problems and generally not adherent to prescribed physical activity. This study will investigate if treatment with vitamin D will benefit physical performance in male veterans age 65 to 95.",Frail Elderly|Vitamin d Deficiency
NCT00609973,Ciprofloxacin for the Prevention of Postoperative Endoscopic Recurrence in Crohn's Disease,"Despite extensive medical treatment, surgical resection is required in approximately 70% of the patients at some time. However, recurrence of the disease after operation occurs in the majority of patients and is a serious limitation of surgical management. Therapeutic options to maintain postoperative clinical remission are urgently needed. Several drugs including mesalazine, antibiotics (metronidazole, ornidazole) and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine have been studied in the past. But the efficacy is very limited (mesalazine), overshadowed by intolerability during long-term therapy (metronidazole, ornidazole) or inconclusive (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine). Research demonstrating the absence of inflammation in patients with diverting ileostomy and the clinical benefit of a postoperative antibiotic therapy using metronidazole or ornidazole implicates a role of the resident bacterial flora in the postoperative relapse. Ciprofloxacin has a broad antibacterial spectrum. More interestingly it also suppresses E. coli strains, which can be found in high numbers in early and chronic ileal lesions of Crohn's disease patients Ciprofloxacin has demonstrated beneficial effects in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases, but the available data of the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin allow only a very limited judgement of the safety and tolerability of a 6 months therapy of ciprofloxacin. Therefore an exploratory multicenter prospective, placebo-controlled trial is planned to analyze the safety and tolerability of a 6 months therapy with ciprofloxacin compared to placebo in 40 patients (randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio) undergoing ileocecal resection (or resection of parts of the colon). If this therapeutic regimen demonstrates tolerability, a second larger study improving the superiority of ciprofloxacin versus placebo can be initiated.",Crohn's Disease
NCT03679273,Nutritional Supplement on Wound Healing in Diabetic Foot,"Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is the leading cause of non-traumatic limb loss in adult worldwide. One of the major causes of limb loss in patients with DFU is poor wound healing. It is known that nutrition plays a key role in wound healing, not only because of the required calories, but more importantly for collagen remodeling by specific amino acids (arginine, glutamine, and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate).Nevertheless, few studies have investigated nutritional supplements in patients with poor wound healing of DFU. Difficulties in assessing the severity of a wound and poor adherence to drug and food supplements at home may be important factors for the negative results shown in a most recent prospective randomized controlled trial. The diabetic foot center in Chang Gung Memorial hospital has extensive experience in caring for patients with limb-threatening DFU and we recently reported that poor nutritional status in our patients correlated to poor treatment outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and possible molecular mechanisms in nutritional treatment for limb-threatening DFU. A total of 70 patients will be enrolled and randomized into study and control groups. All subjects will receive standard care. Additional amino acid supplements containing arginine, glutamine, and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate or a control (high protein formula powder) will be given orally twice a day for 21 days, and the percentage change in wound size will then be measured. Complete healing time, recurrence or major adverse cardiac events will be recorded during one year of follow up. Data on wound size, nutritional status, and levels of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, nutrient molecules (measured by ABSOLUTE/DQ P180 KIT (LC MS/MS) will be recorded before and after the nutritional supplementation. In addition, the pioneer factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) that binds native chromatin and bookmarks genomic regions for transcriptional activity may play a role in nutritional supplements in acute stressed diabetic patients. Therefore, we intend to conduct a pilot study on the for FOXA2 gene in maintaining glucose homeostasis in diabetic foot patients after nutritional interventions.",Diabetic Foot
NCT05214573,Second-line Therapies for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Moderate Cardiovascular Disease Risk,"We will use the target trial framework for causal inference to conduct this observational retrospective cohort study that uses claims data of adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) included in the de-identified datasets of OptumLabs Data Warehouse (OLDW) and Medicare fee-for-service.In Aim 1, we will emulate a target trial comparing the effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), and sulfonylureas (SU) in adults with T2D at moderate risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with regard to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), expanded MACE, microvascular complications, severe hypoglycemia, and other adverse events.In Aim 2, we will compare these four drug classes in the same population of adults with T2D included in OLDW and Medicare fee-for-service data with respect to a set of composite outcomes identified by a group of patients with T2D as being most important to them. Specifically, in Aim 2A, we will prospectively elicit patient preferences toward various treatment outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, kidney disease) using a participatory ranking exercise, then use these rankings to generate individually weighted composite outcomes. Then, in Aim 2B, we will estimate patient-centered treatment effects of four different second-line T2D medications that reflect the patient's value for each outcome.In Aim 3, we will compare different medications within each of the four therapeutic classes with respect to MACE.",Type 2 Diabetes|Cardiac Disease
NCT05702931,Semaglutide Treatment for Hyperglycaemia After Renal Transplantation,"Background: Post-transplant hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in renal transplant recipients within the first two weeks after transplantation. Standard-of-care is primarily based on insulin treatment with the adherent risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Semaglutide produces an effective lowering of plasma glucose in diabetes patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and leads to a reduction in weight and the incidence of hypoglycaemia. The efficacy of semaglutide is untested in renal transplant recipients, and safety concerns remain, primarily on renal graft function.Objectives: The primary objective is to establish whether tablet semaglutide (Rybelsus) compared with placebo, both as add-on to standard-of-care, is non-inferior in regulating plasma glucose in patients with hyperglycaemia after renal transplantation. Secondary objectives aim to evaluate the effect of tablet semaglutide on renal graft function, weight, use of insulin, cardiovascular parameters and safety parameters (plasma semaglutide concentration, gastrointestinal side effects, dose of immunosuppressants).Design: An investigator-initiated, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, randomised trial.Population: Patients (n = 104) with post-transplant hyperglycaemia and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \> 15 ml/min/1.73 m2.Methods: Participants diagnosed with post-transplant hyperglycaemia, 10 to 15 days post-transplant, will be randomised 1:1 to either 14 weeks of tablet semaglutide once daily or placebo both as add-on to standard glucose-lowering therapy. Participants will maintain weekly contact with the clinic during the first five weeks and at two to four weeks intervals during the remaining study period. During the trial, each patient will be monitored according to blood laboratory values with safety assessed at every visit by a nephrologist. Pre-prandial plasma glucose will be measured in the morning and evening to adjust glucose-lowering therapy after consultation with an endocrinologist. Double blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will be performed for 10-14 days from baseline and at weeks 5, 9, and 13.Primary endpoint:- Mean sensor glucose (mmol/L) evaluated by CGMKey secondary endpoints:* Incidence of hypoglycaemia* Body weight (kg)* Creatinine (μmol/L)* Daily insulin dose (IE per day)* Plasma concentration of semaglutide (nmol/L)* Blood concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus (μg/L)",Hyperglycemia|Renal Transplant Complication Primary Non-Function|Diabetes

NCT01954927,Pain Management in Children and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease,"This is a phase II double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the effect of gabapentin when added to standard pain management for patients with sickle cell disease experiencing acute pain crisis in the ambulatory care setting.Sickle cell pain is different for every patient. Some patients get complete relief from routine pain medicines, and others need more time or more doses of pain medicines before the pain goes away completely. It is known that humans have many types of pain, including something called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain in other conditions (such as diabetes) has been treated successfully with a medicine called gabapentin. The investigators in this study suspect that some sickle cell pain is a combination of pain types. They would like to see if adding gabapentin to the usual pain medicines makes pain go away faster or more completely.Primary Objective:* To assess the analgesic efficacy of gabapentin vs. placebo for pain during vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in participants with sickle cell disease (SCD). A response to study drug will be defined by a decrease in pain score of ≥ 33% between presentation to the acute care setting and assessment at 3 hours post administration of study drug.Secondary Objective:* To compare the total morphine equivalent dose (mg/kg) used to control pain during VOC between presentation to the acute care setting and assessment at 3 hours post administration of study drug in the gabapentin vs. placebo groups.",Sickle Cell Disease

NCT03135873,Mastiha Treatment for Obese With NAFLD Diagnosis,"NAFLD/NASH is one of the most common complications of obesity and diabetes mellitus in Western populations affecting approximately 50% of diabetics and 76% of obese patients. Due to the lack of specialized treatment, many new efforts focus on exploring alternative, non-pharmacologic means for managing the disease, including bioactive substances in fruits, vegetables and plants or their products. Mastiha, a natural product of Greece, consists of a great variety of bioactive phytochemical compounds and demonstrates antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial and lipid lowering properties. Taking into account the contribution of oxidative stress and inflammation to NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis, the hypothesis that Mastiha could improve disease aspects is investigated. Thus, design of a multicenter (4 centers across Europe), randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled (parallel arm) clinical trial to assess the effect of Mastiha on clinical course of NAFLD/NASH patients has been conducted. The effectiveness of the proposed intervention will be evaluated via clinical and laboratory markers. MAST4HEALTH aims also at exploring gene-diet interactions and at correlating genetic and epigenetic markers with metabolomic and intestinal microbiota profiles pre- and post- intervention. To this end, patients with confirmed NAFLD/NASH will be allocated to either verum or placebo group. Duration of the intervention will be 6 months and the dosage applied will be 2.1 g daily. NAFLD/NASH diagnosis will be confirmed by MS scanning and the sensitive LiverMultiScan technique. Anthropometric, demographic data, body composition, dietary habits, physical activity, family history and smoking status will be assessed pre- and post- intervention. Biochemical profile, oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as epigenetic and metabolomic profiles will be assessed in blood samples, while the metagenome profile will be examined in stools. Both groups will receive counselling to allow for body weight regulation up to 5%. Compliance will be assessed monthly and side effects will be reported.",Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
NCT05334173,Gastric Bypass With Different Lengths of the Bilipancreatic Limb,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) has been the most performed bariatric surgical intervention until a few years ago, due to its good results in terms of weight loss and remission of comorbidities such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. However, more than 25% of patients do not obtain the expected result.There is no uniform technique to perform a LRYGB, but traditionally it was constructed using a long alimentary limb (AL) and a short biliopancreatic limb (BPL). There is no current consensus on the ideal length of the LRYGB limbs.The distal gastric bypass at the expense of a longer biliopancreatic limb (LBPL-GB) could induce more excess of weight loss (EWL%), but with possible protein malnutrition depending on the length of the remaining common limb.The aim of this study is compare a LBPL-GB (BPL 150cm, AL 70cm) with LAL-GB (BPL 70cm, AL 150cm).PRIMARY OUTCOME: to evaluate if there are differences in weight loss. SECONDARY OUTCOME: to assess whether there are differences in both groups in remission of the most common comorbidities and in quality of life.DESIGN: multicenter, prospective, randomized study in blocks (1:1), blinded for the patient and to the surgeon up to the time of intervention, in patients with indication of RYGB for obesity (BMI\>35 with associated comorbidity or BMI\>40 with or without comorbidity, excluding those of BMI\>50). Intervention: LRYGB type 1 (LAL-GB: 150cm ALand 70cm BPL) or type 2 (LBPL-GB: 70cm AL and 150cm BPL).The expected result is that the patients with LBPL-GB present better EWL%, and higher remission of their comorbidities than the comparison group","Laparoscopic-Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass|Obesity|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2|Hypertension|Dyslipidemias|Sleep Apnea"

NCT00433173,Insulin Sensitivity in Men With the Metabolic Syndrome,"The metabolic syndrome is a medical condition defined by high levels of cholesterol in the blood, high blood pressure, central obesity (gain in fat around the region of the stomach), and insulin resistance (body responds less well to insulin). This state of impaired insulin resistance can lead to type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is one of the most common metabolic disorders in the U.S. Numerous studies have shown an inverse relationship between insulin resistance and testosterone levels in men, however, causality has not been established. This protocol investigates the role of testosterone in modulating insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant states such as the metabolic syndrome.

NCT01865227,"Obesity Surgery, Counseling, and Psychological Well-Being","Obesity has become a global epidemic causing enormous human and economic costs. Incidence rates have doubled over the last few decades and obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases now constitute one of the major contributors to the global burden of disability. Overall, obesity has been recognized as one of the most pressing public health concerns worldwide and effective treatment and prevention strategies are urgently required. While behavioral and pharmacological treatments (e.g.low calorie diets, medication) are successful means for overcoming overweight and mild obesity, more severe cases of obesity usually fail to respond to such interventions. As a result, the demand for weight loss surgery is growing among this population. However, uncertainties about the effectiveness of obesity surgery persist and high relapse rates (i.e. weight regain) are common. Further research in this field is needed to identify risk factors that may trigger relapse and to understand patients' treatment needs in greater depth. Previous studies have pointed toward high levels of mental health problems among patients. However, the impact of preoperative psychopathology on actual surgery outcomes remains unclear. Similarly, few studies have investigated the effect of postoperative therapy on patients' psychological functioning and weight loss patterns. Research addressing these gaps is imperative to establish best-practice approaches. This challenge applies in particular to Middle East and North Africa(MENA) countries where research in the field of bariatric surgery and related mental health is largely missing. This is a major concern given the fact that the MENA region experienced the highest increase in overweight and obesity in recent decades compared to other countries.The proposed study aims to address this deficiency by examining obesity surgery patients in two Arab countries (UAE and Jordan). The goals of the project are to investigate the nature and extent of psychological health concerns among these patients before and after surgery and potential associations with treatment outcomes. Moreover, it will test the efficacy of post-operative counseling to improve weight loss and psychological health. For this purpose, a randomized clinical trial design will be employed so that cause and effect relationships between postoperative counseling and treatment outcomes(i.e. weight loss and psychological functioning) can be examined experimentally. The study will start by assessing participants' psychological health prior to surgery by using standardized self-report measures.After surgery, participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention condition consisting of 3-monthly post-operative medical checkups plus group counseling or the treatment as usual condition (i.e. 3-monthly standard medical checkups only). Additionally, participants' psychological health will be reassessed in both groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery. The benefit of the experimental study design is that it allows comparing patient outcomes between groups while at the same time controlling for a wide range of potential confounding variables.The data collected are expected to make a significant contribution to the treatment challenge of one of the most pressing public health concerns worldwide. Study results will add to clinical practice by broadening and deepening our knowledge of the treatment needs of obese patients. By identifying psychological health concerns that may threaten successful treatment outcomes high-risk patient groups can be recognized early, which in turn may help to reduce postoperative weight regain and other complications.To the best of the PI's knowledge, the proposed work would be the first study of this kind in the Arab world. Findings will be helpful for developing culturally sensitive and evidence-based best-practice guidelines, which are vital to achieve satisfying long-term outcomes. Moreover, study results will be relevant for research communities and practitioners outside the MENA region since empirical support for the effectiveness of obesity surgery remains weak internationally.",Obesity|Bariatric Surgery

NCT05024227,The Effect of Nursing Education Intervention on Women's Health Literacy of Plasticizers,"Environmental hormone (environmental hormone), also known as ""endocrine disrupting chemicals"" (EDCS), is a pollutant that affects the endocrine system and causes diseases and dysfunction throughout the life cycle. Many daily products are ubiquitous, and the most common are phthalates (plasticizers); in recent years, many scientific research reports have determined the adverse health effects of phthalates, including: Infertility (Den Hond et al. al., 2015), testicular hypoplasia (Fisher, 2004), obesity (Dirtu et al., 2013), diabetes (Fénichel \& Chevalier, 2017), hyperglycemia (Williams et al., 2016), asthma (Wang et al., 2016) al., 2015), endometriosis and high abortion rate (Roy et al., 2015), polycystic ovary syndrome (Vagi et al., 2014), prostate cancer (Chuang et al., 2020), and Breast cancer (Chen et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2017; Holmes et al., 2014; López-Carrillo et al., 2010), etc. In 2011, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration detected di（2-ethylhexyl）phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in foods, food supplements, and beverages, and determined that the Taiwanese population has a high content of phthalates (Yang et al., 2013). It pointed out that exposure to plasticizers in the uterus will have lifelong effects and even endanger the health of the next generation, indicating that there is a significant positive correlation between the concentration of metabolites in the urine of pregnant women and the urine of their children (Lin et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2013), even related to children's autism (Carter \& Blizard, 2016; Rossignol et al., 2014).However, so far there is still a lack of research on environmental hormone-plasticizers to improve health literacy or develop interventional research. Therefore, this study hopes to track the health literacy of their plasticizers and provide nursing education interventions (including e-health platform assistance) for women. Randomized controlled trials (English: randomized controlled trial, RCT) will be used to test nursing education interventions using a double-blind trial system. (Including e-health platform assistance) Effectiveness, in order to provide simple and fast self-health monitoring and management for the people, and it is expected that the case can early prevent the occurrence of related diseases and ensure the safety of the living environment.",Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals|Health Literacy
NCT03446573,Switch Study to Evaluate Dolutegravir Plus Lamivudine in Virologically Suppressed Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Positive Adults (TANGO),"The aim of the study is to establish if human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected adult participants with current virologic suppression on a \>=3-drug tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based regimen (TBR) remain suppressed upon switching to a two-drug regimen of dolutegravir (DTG) 50 milligram (mg) + lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg. This study will also provide important information regarding the safety and participant satisfaction with this two-drug regimen. The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to DTG + 3TC once daily compared to continuation of TBR over 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced, virologically suppressed participants.

NCT03334773,Nutrition Education Intervention for Adults With Type 2 Diabetes,"Aim: To implement a nutrition education programme (intervention) for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) adapted from a primary health care setting to a tertiary hospital setting in South Africa and to evaluate the programme's effectiveness on dietary behaviours, clinical status and selected potential behaviour mediators.Participants and setting: T2DM adults (40-70 years) and at least one year of living with diabetes and poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 8%). The study setting is the outpatient clinic of a tertiary teaching hospital in Tshwane District (Pretoria), South Africa.Intervention: The intervention will employ a randomised control design with two parallel groups (intervention \& control). A total sample of 140 T2DM patients (70 per group) will be needed to detect a 0.5 % change in HbA1c (SD of 1.0 and a power of 80%) at six month and allowing a 10% attrition rate. The intervention is one-year long with the following components: 7-monthly group education sessions; 2 bi-monthly group follow-up sessions at the hospital till one year; participants' workbook for goal setting activities and education materials (pamphlet and wall/fridge poster) for the intervention group. The control group will receive the same education materials with no other education encounters. Both groups will continue with usual care at the diabetes outpatient clinic of the hospital. The education will be offered face to face, will utilize teaching aids including coloured posters and will incorporate interactive group activities and demonstrations. The main facilitator is a qualified dietitian.Outcomes: Outcomes will be assessed at 6-and 12 months for both groups with the six month being the primary outcome. Outcomes will include clinical \[HbA1c (primary outcome), BMI, blood pressure and full lipid profile); dietary behaviours (energy intake, starchy food servings, vegetable and fruits intake, macronutrient intake and their distribution to energy, fibre, meal pattern) and selected potential mediators of behavior (diabetes knowledge and diabetes management self- efficacy).It is hypothesized that the intervention will lower the HbA1c levels by at least 0.5% at six months and the levels will be significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group, and the significantly lower levels will be sustained at 12 months in the intervention group.",Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

NCT03308773,Disease Prevention in Clinical Practice Base on Patient Specific Physiology,"It is well known that the Type 2 diabetes and vascular disease are preceded by over ten years by metabolic dysfunction and anatomic changes that can be quantified. In order to develop effective preventive strategies and reduce the cost burden to the health care system, recognition of the earliest pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes and vascular disease is clinically relevant. The interval retrospective evaluation of data from patient records, reflect the effectiveness of the various treatments implemented in clinical practice.Prevalence of ""prediabetes"" among American adults is estimated to be \~84 million, or one out of three Americans. Over a 5-7 year period approximately one third of these prediabetic individuals will progress to type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes is a heterogenous group comprised of individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and increased A1c (5.7-6.4%). Although different pathophysiologies are present in individuals with IFG and IGT, their conversion rate to overt type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is similar.Insulin resistance is a common causal feature of many of the pathophysiologic mechanisms linking macrovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Because hyperglycemia is the major factor responsible for the development of microvascular complications, it logically follows that prevention of progression of prediabetes to overt diabetes should retard/prevent the development of the microvascular complications. From the measurement of plasma glucose, insulin, and c-peptide levels during the oral glucose tolerance test, one can derive measures of the two core defects responsible for the development of T2DM, i.e. insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction as well as the degree of dysglycemia.By combining a standard medical evaluation with the evaluation of cardiovascular biomarkers, patients at intermediate risk of vascular disease can be identified. In these patients, carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and carotid plaque evaluation is offered to attempt to clarify risk.The hypothesis of this observational study is that the characterization of the physiology and anatomy of patients at risk of developing type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease can stratify risk of developing disease and direct treatment strategies tailored to the identified physiologic defect, leading to improvements in the delay or prevention of disease.",PreDiabetes|Insulin Resistance|Type2 Diabetes|NASH - Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis|Diastolic Dysfunction|Dementia|Atrial Fibrillation|Cancer|Atherosclerosis|Carotid Plaque

NCT03230760,Acupuncture for Breast Engorgement During Lactation,"Breast engorgement which may manifest swell, throb, and cause mild to extreme pain is the common difficulty for breast feeding woman. It occurs in the mammary glands due to expansion and pressure exerted by the synthesis and storage of breast milk and it usually happens when the breasts switch from colostrums to mature milk. However, engorgement can also happen if lactating women miss several nursing and not enough milk is expressed from the breasts. It can be exacerbated by insufficient breastfeeding and/or blocked milk ducts. Engorgement may lead to mastitis and untreated engorgement puts pressure on the milk ducts, often causing a plugged duct.According the meridian theory, the investigators propose the acupuncture treatment for patients of breast engorgement.The investigators will include 60 patients and measure the acupuncture effect. The inclusion criteria are women with breast engorgement and 20 years old or older. Exclusion standards are patients with: 1. diabetes mellitus 2. Psychological disease or mental illness 3.

We will also Investigate the factors that explain how the interventions influence hypertension and diabetes management and explore barriers/facilitators to delivering and sustaining intervention. We will conduct mixed-methods research to understand how the intervention influences treatment and prevention in this patient population. Particularly, we will assess lifestyle changes (i.e., smoking, dietary salt intake, physical activity, alcohol consumption), and burden for patients (e.g., waiting time, travel-related cost) at individual and community level. Qualitative data will shed light on facilitators and barriers to hypertension and diabetes prevention and control from the perspectives of patients (and their families), primary care providers, public health officials, and other stakeholders. Additionally, we will undertake a health economic evaluation of the interventions for primary care systems. A comprehensive evaluation of cost and effectiveness will be important for the models tested, providing necessary evidence for policymakers and stakeholders to scale up the interventions. We hypothesize that compared with usual care, the multicomponent decentralized primary care will improve all steps along hypertension and diabetes care continuum. On the other hand, we hypothesize that the mHealth intervention alone (Simple App) may improve BP and glycemic control compared with usual care but will have a limited impact on rates of screening, diagnosis, and treatment. We also hypothesize that the multicomponent integrated care will lead to a higher treatment success rate relative to mHealth intervention alone.",Hypertension|Diabetes

NCT06939673,Study of Miro3D Wound Matrix for Healing Wounds and Ulcers in Outpatient Care,"This clinical study is being conducted to evaluate how well the Miro3D Wound Matrix helps heal difficult wounds and ulcerations in an outpatient care setting. Miro3D is a biologic wound dressing made from porcine (pig) liver tissue. It is processed to remove all cells, creating a clean scaffold that can support the body's natural healing process. The goal of this study is to see how effective Miro3D is when used alongside standard wound care for helping wounds close and reducing pain and discomfort.The study is designed as a post-market, proof-of-concept trial, meaning the product is already commercially available, and researchers are evaluating how it works in real-world clinical settings. A total of up to 20 adult participants will be enrolled. Participants may have wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, or surgical wound dehiscence. These wounds may be complex in nature, including tunneling or undermining, which often makes them more difficult to treat.Participants will receive standard wound care along with weekly Miro3D applications for the first 4 weeks. If the wound is not fully healed after 4 weeks, Miro3D will then be applied every 2 weeks until healing is achieved or up to 12 weeks total. Throughout the study, participants will return weekly for wound assessments and to complete brief questionnaires about their pain levels and quality of life.The main goals of the study are:1. To measure how much the wound size shrinks (known as percent area reduction or PAR).2. To evaluate how much healthy granulation tissue (new tissue) forms in the wound.3. To compare healing outcomes when Miro3D is used weekly versus every two weeks.4. To understand how the treatment affects patients' quality of life, including pain, mobility, and emotional wellbeing.Each participant will be closely monitored by the clinical team throughout the 12-week study period.

Although rates of ISR have decreased in most recent years owing to newer generation drug-eluting stents, thinner struts, and better intravascular imaging modalities, ISR remains a prevalent dilemma that proves to be challenging to manage. Several factors have been proposed to contribute to ISR formation, including mechanical stent characteristics, technical factors during the coronary intervention, and biological aspects of drug-eluting stents .identiﬁcation of risk factors and mechanisms underlying ISR is necessary for understanding the process, the risk stratiﬁcation, and optimal treatment development. Restenosis, as a physiological response to mechanical damage, involves two mechanisms which are neointimal hyperplasia and vessel remodeling \[3\]. Several factors such as age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stenting of small coronary arteries, and ﬁnal total length of stents have been shown to be associated with an elevated risk of restenosis.",Angiotensin Converting Enzyme rs (1799752) Gene Polymorphism and Development of In-Stent Restenosis in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Diseases

NCT04012294,Effects of Allopurinol on Inflammation and Ultrasonographic Changes in People With Elevated Uric Acid But no Symptoms,"Hyperuricemia is a metabolic alteration defined as the presence of serum urate levels higher than 7 mg/dL. This has proven to be the maximum limit of solubility of urate in serum, any higher concentration leads to precipitation and eventually to the formation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. The accumulation of said crystals can manifest as gouty arthritis, uric acid nephropathy, urolithiasis or chronic tophaceous gout.A strong relation between hyperuricemia and other chronic degenerative diseases, including diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension, obesity and metabolic syndrome, has been consistently proven.Hypouricemic pharmacological agents have shown a decrease in cardiovascular complications and death in patients with gout.A series of studies conducted on individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia using musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) have shown the presence of morphostructural changes suggestive of MSU crystal deposits, combined with an elevation in a series of inflammation markers to a degree similar to those found in patients with chronic gout.Even though, there is evidence of morphostructural damage in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia, there are no clinical, laboratorial or imaging parameters that indicate when hypouricemic treatment should be started.This clinical trial is proposed as a proof of concept which is looking to evaluate if treatment with allopurinol induces changes in levels of inflammatory markers in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia and morphostructural changes suggestive of MSU crystal deposits. this proof of concept is not looking to measure the efficiency, effectiveness or security of the treatment.Our Hypothesis is that Individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia and morphostructural changes evidenced by MSUS (double contour sing, tophi, aggregates) will show a decent in inflammatory markers and their morphostructural changes will diminish or revert after treatment with allopurinol.",Musculoskeletal Degeneration|Inflammation|Hyperuricemia

NCT01638260,GLP-1 and Non-exercise Activity Thermogenesis in RHZ,"- Rationale: Treatment with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has been shown to reduce plasma glucose levels to a further extent when added to standard therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given the well-known beneficial effects of GLP-1 analogues on glucose metabolism by stimulating insulin release, suppressing elevated glucagon levels, delaying gastric emptying and reducing food intake, it is anticipated that liraglutide developed by Novo Nordisk (Victoza®) also has beneficial effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus as has been proven by several trials. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with obesity and sedentary lifestyle. Obesity occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure (EE) over a period of time. It has been presumed that activity energy expenditure and daily energy expenditure are lower in most people in Western societies. Increasing non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), defined as all energy expended due to everyday activity, exclusive of volitional exercise, may be an effective way to maintain daily EE and combat overweight and obesity. One way to promote NEAT is to decrease the amount of time spent on sedentary behaviors (e.g. watching television).This leads us to hypothesize that adding NEAT to GLP-1 analogues in type 2 diabetes has an additive effect on glucose regulation, weight control and blood pressure. On the other hand, we hypothesize that a decrease in HbA1c, weight and blood pressure could add to an improved quality of life and less health care costs. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to determine the synergistic effect of liraglutide and activating lifestyle by increasing NEAT on glucose metabolism and weight. First line therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus currently consists of lifestyle changes with metformin. When failure of this regime occurs, sulfonylurea derivates and/or thiazolidinediones can be added. One third of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus fail with this regimen after 5 years of monotherapy, and nowadays GLP-1 analogues can be added to prevent deterioration of glycaemic control. However, comparison of this strategy with NEAT has not been performed and the synergistic effect of combination of GLP-1 with increasing NEAT has not been investigated. Treatment with GLP-1 analogues in combination with NEAT could theoretically overcome all shortcomings of current treatment strategies of type 2 diabetes mellitus.Objective:* Primary objectives  * To determine the change in HbA1c from baseline and end of treatment (26 weeks) and end of follow-up (52 weeks) after 26 weeks of treatment with liraglutide versus liraglutide with NEAT  * To determine the change in weight from baseline and end of treatment (26 weeks) and end of follow-up (52 weeks) after 26 weeks of treatment with liraglutide versus liraglutide with NEAT* Secondary objectives  * To assess the change in blood pressure from baseline and end of treatment (26 weeks) and end of follow-up (52 weeks) after 26 weeks of treatment with liraglutide versus liraglutide with NEAT  * To assess the change in quality of life from baseline and end of treatment (26 weeks) and end of follow-up (52 weeks) after 26 weeks of treatment with liraglutide versus liraglutide with NEAT  * To assess the change in NEAT from baseline and end of treatment (26 weeks) and end of follow-up (52 weeks) after 26 weeks of treatment with liraglutide versus liraglutide with NEAT  * To asses the health-care related costs at baseline, after 26 weeks of treatment with liraglutide versus liraglutide with NEAT, and after 52 weeks (end of follow-up)Study design: Randomized controlled intervention study- Study population: Men and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus, insufficiënt glycaemic control during maximum (tolerable) dose monotherapy with metformin or a sulfonylurea derivate or during combination therapy with metformin and a sulfonylurea derivate or a thiazolinedione, HbA1c above 7,0%, age between 40 - 75 years old, BMI above 25 kg/m2Intervention: One group receives once daily subcutaneously liraglutide 1.8mg added to standard anti-diabetic care and the other group receives once daily subcutaneously liraglutide 1.8mg added to standard anti-diabetic care and an activating lifestyle by increasing NEATMain study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is the percent change in HbA1c and weight.

NCT05305794,"Effect of Weekly GLP1 Agonist Treatment in ""double Diabetes""","Between 16% and 22% of type 1 diabetic patients present a clinical and biological profile of insulin resistance favored by a family history of type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. They constitute a group of patients with ""double diabetes"" since they have both true type 1 diabetes and inherited insulin resistance, typical of type 2 diabetes.For several years, GLP1 agonists have been successfully used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, leading to very significant improvements in glycemic control and weight loss.Because of the insulin-sensitizing power of GLP1 agonists, the investigators hypothesize that they could reduce insulin resistance in patients with ""double diabetes"" and thus improve their glycemic control.The investigators propose to use in this study semaglutide, the most recent and most potent GLP1 agonist (superiority demonstrated compared to exenatide LP and dulaglutide) and administered as a weekly subcutaneous injection (in contrast to liraglutide administered daily).",Double Diabetes
