NCT02169531,Ex Vivo Immunotherapy for Hyperglycemia in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a long-term metabolic disorder that is primarily characterized by insulin resistance, relative insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Our hypotheses is that liver would be the primary organ responsible for the metabolic disorder because of some unknown defects, where sugar would not be efficiently converted to glycogen and fat, leading to hyperglycemia. The constant hyperglycemia would keep pressure on beta-cells in the pancreas to eventually exhaust their ability to produce and secret sufficient amount of insulin, exacerbating the disease. The Immunotherapy would enhance the liver functions and correct the abnormal sugar metabolism. In addition, the ex vivo activated cells produce and secret growth factors which would help endothelial cells of blood vessels to reproduce and grow, resulting in reduced arteriosclerosis.",Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus|Hyperglycemia
NCT06308627,A One-year Trajectory of Depression Status Changes in Older Adults With MCI and SD: a Longitudinal Cohort Study,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the one-year trajectory of changes in depression status in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and subthreshold depression, and to explore relevant risk factors for predicting changes in depression status. This one-year prospective longitudinal follow-up study involved 400 (expected) subjects who met the diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment combined with subthreshold depression in older adults, and their depressive status was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Follow up monitoring of depression status at 6 and 12 months. Obtain factors related to changes in depressive status (such as age, gender, education level, cognitive function, anxiety level, sleep status, social support, psychological resilience, social network, etc.). By studying the longitudinal trajectory of depression status in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment and subthreshold depression, a multi state Markov model with time and state discreteness is constructed, namely: State 1 (normal); State 2 (subthreshold depression); State 3 (mild depression); State 4 (moderate depression); State 5 (severe depression). Deeply explore and analyze the impact of certain factors and indicators on the transition between states, and estimate the probability of transition between states.",Mild Cognitive Impairment|Subthreshold Depression|Older Adults
NCT01987427,"A Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Parallel-group, Pilot Study of 12-week Duration to Assess the Short-term Safety and Tolerability of Lorcaserin Plus Two Doses of Immediate-Release Phentermine-HCl Compared With Lorcaserin Alone in Overweight and Obese Adults","APD356-A001-402 is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group pilot study of 12-week duration in overweight and obese adults. Approximately 225 subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment arms in a ratio 1:1:1 and will receive the combinations of lorcaserin 10 mg twice daily (BID) plus immediate-release phentermine-HCl 15 mg BID or 15 mg once daily (QD), or lorcaserin alone.",Chronic Weight Management
NCT03301727,Sleeping for Two: RCT of CBT-Insomnia in Pregnancy,"Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to be an effective treatment for insomnia in multiple populations, including women during pregnancy and postpartum. Online CBT-I has also been shown to be effective and comparable to in-person CBT-I, and shows promise as an accessible treatment alternative to in-person CBT-I for pregnant women experiencing insomnia. As the harmful consequences of insomnia or sleep disturbances have been well documented during late pregnancy, this randomized-controlled trial will compare the efficacy of both in-person and online CBT-I on pregnant women with insomnia to a wait-list control group.",Insomnia|Sleep Disturbance
NCT06837831,Efficacy of Mepilex Lite Dressings in Treating Anal Pain,"BACKGROUND: Rectal cancer is a common gastrointestinal tumor, and low and intermediate rectal cancer accounts for 90% of rectal cancer. Radiotherapy is one of the important means of rectal cancer treatment, but the radiotoxicity induced by radiotherapy should not be neglected. As normal tissues around the target organ of radiotherapy, the anal canal is damaged by radiation and mucous membrane damage occurs, which is manifested as mucous membrane congestion, edema and ulceration, etc., and pain in the anal area occurs. With the accumulation of radiotherapy dose, the mucosal damage of the anal canal becomes more and more serious, and the anal pain of the patients is severe, which seriously affects the life quality of the patients. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of mepilex lite dressings combined with indomethacin suppositories in the treatment of anal pain in patients undergoing radiotherapy for low and intermediate rectal cancer.METHODS: The study protocol will be a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A randomized grouping method was used to divide the participants into an observation group (n=98) and a control group (n=98). The control group was given routine nursing measures, and the experimental group was given mepilex lite dressings for intra-anal insertion combined with indomethacin suppository for anal administration on the basis of routine nursing measures. The primary outcome indicator was anal pain score. Secondary outcome indicators were anxiety score, sleep quality score and comfort score. Assessments were made at baseline (anal pain NRS score ≥7 in patients undergoing radiotherapy for low to intermediate rectal cancer), day 1, day 7 and day 14 post-intervention. Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS 25.0 and a significance level of p≤0.05 will be used for all tests.","Rectal Cancer, Radiotherapy|Anal Pain"

NCT04112927,Acoustic OSA Prediction During Wakefulness and Monitoring During Sleep,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of sound analysis for: a) sleep apnea detection both during wakefulness and sleep, and b) flow-sound relationship during both wakefulness and sleep in patients and control individuals. The ultimate goal of our research is to simplify the current assessments for sleep apnea detection so that it is more convenient for patients and also much faster than the current techniques.",Obstructive Sleep Apnea
