It is also found associated with lung, gastric, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. Although there are existing therapies that can target HER2, most patients will eventually experience progression of their disease even though their cancer continues to express HER2. Therefore, new approaches are needed for treating tumors that express HER2.This clinical trial will use an investigational cancer vaccine called HER2 VRP or AVX901. The vaccine is based on a virus called Venezuelan equine encephalitis but it has been changed so it cannot cause active infection. Instead, the virus has been changed so it tells the immune system to attack cancer cells which make HER2.The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of immunization with HER2 VRP in patients with advanced or metastatic malignancies that express HER2, and to test whether immunization will causes a strong immune system attack against the cancer.",NO,HER2+ Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: AVX901,"Safety, The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of immunization with HER2 ECDTM VRP in patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-expressing malignancies, 3 months","Immune response, The secondary objective of the study HER2 specific response by ELISPOT and ELISA., 3 months",,H.

Ribociclib and tucatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast tumor cells. Fulvestrant blocks the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.

It is thought that this receptor is turned ""on"" in some cancers, enabling cancer cells to divide and grow. Blocking this receptor can turn this signal off. Cetuximab blocks this receptor from the outside of cancer cells. It is thought that cancer cells can turn this signal back on by the EGFR joining with a related receptor called ErbB2. Lapatinib blocks both EGFR and ErbB2 from the inside of cancer cells. In laboratory experiments it has been found that combining drugs that target both EGFR and ErbB2 might work better in turning this signal back off. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum dosages that patients can tolerate when these two medicines are given at the same time.In addition, in order to be on this trial, patients must agree to have a tumor biopsy before starting treatment on this study and 21 days after starting treatment. These biopsies are a required part of the study. Patients must also agree to have blood drawn for research testing to see whether genetic differences between patients explain different reactions to and side effects from, these medicines.",NO,Colorectal Cancer|Lung Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer,DRUG: cetuximab and lapatinib,"Maximum tolerated dose, The dose at which \</= 1 out of 6 subjects experiences a dose limting toxicity, 12 months","response rate, How well tumor responds to treatment as measured by RECIST criteria, 12 months|Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacokinetics of lapatinib as measured by weekly trough levels, 12 months|Genetic polymorphisms, genetic polymorphisms in ABCG2, ABCB1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 wil be identified and counted, 12 months|Genetic variations and activation status for EGFR and ErbB2 pathways, Genetic variations and activation status for EGFR amd ErbB2 pathways will be measured in pre- and post-therapy biopsies and assessed with western blots and IHC., 12 months",,Georgetown University,GlaxoSmithKline,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1,22,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,tykerb-itux 1|2010-218,2010-06,2013-06,2013-09,2010-08-19,,2013-10-31,"Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20007, United States",

Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cetuximab and irinotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

This study wants to learn if small pieces of DNA associated with a tumor (called circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA) can be detected in investigational blood tests during the course of standard chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer, and whether information from such investigational ctDNA blood testing could possibly be used as an early indication of chemotherapy treatment failure. It is hoped that additional information from investigational blood testing for ctDNA could help doctors to switch more quickly from a standard chemotherapy treatment that typically has significant side effects and which may not be working, to a different standard treatment regimen against TNBC, called sacituzumab govitecan. Sacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody, called hRS7, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called irinotecan. hRS7 is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as TROP2 receptors, and delivers irinotecan to kill them.
